# email-text-summarisation

## Using NLP to summarize price-related email conversations between retailers and suppliers

Data Preprocessing:

Extract the text content from the .eml files.
Clean and preprocess the text data by removing irrelevant information, stop words, and formatting issues.
Named Entity Recognition (NER):

Use NER models to identify entities related to products, prices, quantities, retailers, and suppliers in the emails.
This step helps in understanding the key elements in the emails.
Topic Modeling:

Apply topic modeling techniques (such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation - LDA) to identify the main topics in the emails.
This can help in identifying the different products or items discussed in the conversations.
Sentiment Analysis:

Utilize sentiment analysis to understand the sentiment associated with each conversation.
Positive sentiments may indicate a successful negotiation or agreement, while negative sentiments may suggest disputes or disagreements.
Machine Learning Models:

Train a machine learning model to predict whether a price decision was taken for a specific item or not.
Use features like identified entities, sentiment scores, and topic probabilities as inputs to the model.
Text Summarization:

Apply text summarization techniques to generate concise summaries for each email or conversation.
Extract key sentences or phrases that capture the essence of the price-related decisions.
Keyword Extraction:

Extract important keywords related to pricing, products, and decisions to enhance the summary.
Post-Processing:

Review and refine the summaries generated by the models.
Manually check a sample of the summaries to ensure accuracy.
Visualization:

Create visualizations (e.g., word clouds, graphs) to represent the key information extracted from the emails.
Integration:

Integrate the summarization process into your workflow for easy analysis and decision-making.
It's important to note that building and training models for these tasks may require labeled data for supervised learning. Additionally, fine-tuning and adjusting parameters may be necessary to achieve optimal results. Consulting with a machine learning expert or data scientist can be helpful for implementing these steps effectively.
